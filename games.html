        I have a lot to say about this style of leisure
      </p>
      <p>Tabletop gaming is a fabulous experience. However, I find myself being somewhat... selective in the kinds of games I enjoy.
        In particular, I prefer ones that have more <strong>teamwork</strong>&mdash;even if they're not fully co-operative.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a game <strong>designer</strong>, although I have not had anything be published yet.

              <strong>A social deception game with real logic, strategy, and creativity</strong>.
              I really enjoy characters like the <strong>Artist</strong> (ask the "Storyteller" any one yes/no question)&mdash;which is paired with the
              <strong>Vortox</strong> (all good info is false)&mdash;and
              <strong>Amnesiac</strong> (the Storyteller invents your ability, and you have to figure out what exactly it is) that allow you to go above and beyond.
              It's a solid game even with the base game, as you have actual information to base your accusations on...
              but when you include experimental roles, it takes it to a whole new level.
              <br/>
              Blood on the Clocktower is not just a game. It's more of a game system. It is
