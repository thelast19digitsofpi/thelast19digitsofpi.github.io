        I have a lot to say about this style of leisure
      </p>
      <p>Tabletop gaming is a fabulous experience. However, I find myself being somewhat... selective in the kinds of games I enjoy.
        In particular, I prefer ones that have more <strong>teamwork</strong>&mdash;even if they're not fully co-operative.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a game <strong>designer</strong>, although I have not had anything be published yet.

      <h2>
        Tabletop Games
      </h2>
      <p>This section includes mostly board and card games, although Blood on the Clocktower is somewhat of an exception because you don't <i>really</i> have a "board".</p>

      <h3>
        Games I've Created (or am currently creating)
      </h3>
      <p>
        My sort of "flagship" game is <strong>Intrusion Confusion</strong>, which is a 3-6 player hidden traitor game with logic and strategy.
        It's very close to finished (needs a few balancing tweaks, as right now the good team wins a little too often).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a "public domain" game for roughly 4-8 players called <code>This Place Isn't Big Enough For All Of Us</code>,
        that uses dice and a subset of a standard deck of cards. I'm going to post the rules soon.
      </p>

            <td>
              <strong>A social deception game with real logic, strategy, and creativity</strong>.
              I really enjoy characters like the <strong>Artist</strong> (ask the "Storyteller" any one yes/no question)&mdash;which is paired with the
              <strong>Vortox</strong> (all good info is false)&mdash;and
              <strong>Amnesiac</strong> (the Storyteller invents your ability, and you have to figure out what exactly it is) that allow you to go above and beyond.
              It's a solid game even with the base game, as you have actual information to base your accusations on...
              but when you include experimental roles, it takes it to a whole new level.
              <br/>
              Blood on the Clocktower is <strong class="text-success">not just a game</strong>. It's more of a game system. It is reasonably easy to homebrew your own characters, even; I've done that on multiple occasions.

            <td>
              Another one of those "use actual evidence to find the liar" games. This one is more open-ended than most games in the category because you're connecting crime-scene objects (murder weapon and key evidence) with sometimes rather obscure clues (time of day, murderer's personality, relation to victim).
              <br/>
              Only issue is, I have seen some games come down to a lucky draw on the evidence tiles because something points <em>directly</em> to the murder weapon or key evidence.

            <td>
              It's similar to <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames">Codenames</a>, which is more widely known,
              in that one person is giving clues that the rest of their team tries to interpret.
              I appreciate that Decrypto has everyone give clues, but what really seals the deal is how <strong>creative</strong> you can get with your clues in Decrypto.
              You're not limited to a single word. You can give sentences that have red herrings, for instance.
              These open-ended games (as you can tell from Zendo) have a special place in my... heart? mind? whatever?

              It's mostly about trying to discover how your teammates think, which is why I
              <strong class="text-danger">really want to play with the same group more than twice</strong>.

              A long-form co-operative game that flips the narrative of colonization upside down&mdash;now it's the white colonizers who "ravage" and "blight the land".
              It's not technically open-ended, but the camaraderie that develops among players really makes this game shine.
              You have enough of your own problems that "alpha-gaming" isn't an option, but it's simple enough for players to manage "their side" at the beginning,
              and help out the team more near the end of the game.

              It's also not a single-winner game where you have to get the most points.
              Instead, it's a very curious fusion where players Contribute Resources to a Project, and at the end, the X players with the most Influence win... and X is determined by the number of Resources Contributed.
              It's a very interesting concept for sure.

              <strong>The scientific process boiled down to a board game.</strong>
              If it weren't for <a href="#table-botc">Clocktower</a> this would be my all-time favorite (right now the two are essentially tied).
              Zendo is more like a platform for puzzles. Although it is technically a single-winner game, where the player who officially guesses the rule first wins,
              it naturally lends itself to co-operative play as people share ideas while struggling for more complex rules.
              <br/>
              The official pieces are <a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/pyramids-home">pyramids made by Looney Labs</a>
              that come in 3 sizes (marked with pips). On two occasions I used the rule "the total number of pips must be a <strong>prime number</strong>"...
              <em>but</em> it was with math grad students. Both times the rule was solved. The point of the game for the Moderator is not to stump the players,
              but to keep them engaged.

        Some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Three games (Clocktower, Decrypto, and Zendo) allow <strong>unbounded creativity</strong>.
          Between Clocktower's <a href="https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Artist">Artist</a> and <a href="https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Savant">Savant</a>,
          Decrypto allowing multi-word clues (this also helps for non-native speakers),
          and Zendo's entire game concept (you can do stuff like "must contain a set of 4 pieces whose footprints form a Tetris block")...
