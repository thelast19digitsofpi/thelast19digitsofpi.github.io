        I have a lot to say about this style of leisure
      </p>
      <p>Tabletop gaming is a fabulous experience. However, I find myself being somewhat... selective in the kinds of games I enjoy.
        In particular, I prefer ones that have more <strong>teamwork</strong>&mdash;even if they're not fully co-operative.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a game <strong>designer</strong>, although I have not had anything be published yet.

      <h3>
        My favorite published games, in alphabetical order
      </h3>

              <br/>
              (abbreviated "Clocktower")

            <td>
              <strong>A social deception game with real logic, strategy, and creativity</strong>.
              I really enjoy characters like the <strong>Artist</strong> (ask the "Storyteller" any one yes/no question)&mdash;which is paired with the
              <strong>Vortox</strong> (all good info is false)&mdash;and
              <strong>Amnesiac</strong> (the Storyteller invents your ability, and you have to figure out what exactly it is) that allow you to go above and beyond.
              It's a solid game even with the base game, as you have actual information to base your accusations on...
              but when you include experimental roles, it takes it to a whole new level.
              <br/>
              Blood on the Clocktower is not just a game. It's more of a game system. It is reasonably easy to homebrew your own characters, even; I've done that on multiple occasions.

            <td>
              <strong>The scientific process boiled down to a board game.</strong>
              If it weren't for <a href="#table-botc">Clocktower</a> this would be my all-time favorite (right now the two are essentially tied).
              Zendo is more like a platform for puzzles. Although it is technically a single-winner game, where the player who officially guesses the rule first wins,
              it naturally lends itself to co-operative play as people share ideas while struggling for more complex rules.
              <br/>
              The official pieces are <a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/pyramids-home">pyramids made by Looney Labs</a>
              that come in 3 sizes (marked with pips). On two occasions I used the rule "the total number of pips must be a <strong>prime number</strong>"...
              <em>but</em> it was with math grad students. Both times the rule was solved. The point of the game for the Moderator is not to stump the players,
              but to keep them engaged.

        Some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Three games (Clocktower, Decrypto, and Zendo) allow <strong>unbounded creativity</strong>.
          Between Clocktower's <a href="https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Artist">Artist</a> and <a href="https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Savant">Savant</a>,
          Decrypto allowing multi-word clues (this also helps for non-native speakers),
          and Zendo's entire game concept (you can do stuff like "must contain a set of 4 pieces whose footprints form a Tetris block")
