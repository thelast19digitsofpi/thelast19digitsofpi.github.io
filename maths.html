        I am a rogue mathematician... <small>[Page last updated 2022-08-27]</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an ever-expanding list of things I have done, or will do, that pertain to mathematics. This page will always be "under construction", but right now even the formatting is unfinished.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2022 August - present:
          <ul>
            <li>Independent study about quantum computing (just starting)</li>
            <li>Sentence Embedding Machine Learning research (just starting)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>2022 June-August: NSF REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates). Surveyed cryptographic attribute-based access control systems and learned about bilinear cryptography. Joint work with Dr. Xukai Zou (IUPUI) and Kritika Verma (Syracuse University).</li>
        <li>2021 December: Scored 38 (rank 112 out of 2975) on the Putnam Mathematical Competition.</li>
        <li>2021 June-August: Completely independent work on an obscure problem involving intersecting families of finite sets. (Not published... yet. I have a distinct fear that someone else already solved this problem.)</li>
        <li>2020 January-August: Numerical experiments to determine if a particular dynamical system is hyperbolic. Not published.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        As you might or might not be able to tell, I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, but I am leaning towards some combination of quantum computing and cryptography. (Then again, I seem to have missed the party when it comes to designing post-quantum encryption systems, and hash functions of over 256 bits seem to be quantum-safe...)
