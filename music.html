        I have heard many people talk about connections between mathematics and music. A lot of it gets very abstract, with stuff about tempo and pitch and harmonies and whatnot... I do not totally discredit that, and I think it is worth considering.
      </p>

        But I am much more direct than that. My music was made with Python scripts (that generated MIDI files; I had to research the file format myself), which combined with macOS GarageBand creates mathematically precise patterns. The background "ticking" in "Bytes", for example, is just counting in binary. (You can probably figure out what the other patterns are yourself, if you listen.)

        As of July 2022, I do not have a BandCamp, Soundcloud, or other account. So far it has not been worth the trouble, but I am open to the possibility.

        Like several of my songs, the time is <em>supposed</em> to be a perfect power (2<sup>8</sup> seconds = 256 s = 4m16s) but GarageBand adds a few extra seconds to let the final sound die out. Oh well.
