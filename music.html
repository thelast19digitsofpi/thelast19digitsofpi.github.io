        Musical Compositions

      <p>
        I have heard many people talk about connections between mathematics and music. A lot of it gets very abstract, with stuff about tempo and pitch and harmonies and whatnot... I do not totally discredit that, and I think it is worth considering.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I am much more direct than that. My music was made with Python scripts (that generated MIDI files; I had to research the file format myself), which combined with macOS GarageBand creates mathematically precise patterns. The background "ticking" in "Bytes", for example, is just counting in binary. (You can probably figure out what the other patterns are yourself, if you listen.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As of July 2022, I do not have a BandCamp, Soundcloud, or other account. So far it has not been worth the trouble, but I am open to the possibility.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I call this album "Mathematical Songs" just because that's what they are and I never bothered to change it.

      <h4>
        Bytes (4:20)
      </h4>
      <p>
        This one I consider to be my best work. Like several of my songs, the time is <em>supposed</em> to be a perfect power (2<sup>8</sup> seconds = 256 s = 4m16s) but GarageBand adds a few extra seconds to let the final sound die out. Oh well.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said above, the background ticking is counting in binary from 0 to 255 and almost everything else is built around that concept, just in new ways each time.
      </p>
      <p>

      <!-- Binary Tree -->
      <h4>
        Binary Tree (4:16)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Another one based on powers of 2 that pre-dates "Bytes". It has a much simpler build-up of complexity than Bytes' three instruments coming in and out, followed by a mostly symmetrical tear-down in the second half.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tune is based on the A-B-A-C-A-B-A-D-... pattern (or, as the case may be, C-D-C-E-C-D-C-F-...), where each iteration you take the previous sequence, then put one note higher, then do the previous thing all over again:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C-D-C</li>
      </ol>
